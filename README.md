WSO2 Private PaaS delivers standard, on-premise, application, integration, data, identity, governance, and analytics Platform as a Service (PaaS) to your IT project teams. It is a complete, multi-tenant, self-service, metered, middleware cloud for complex, enterprise-ready projects.

Giving you all the power of cloud, WSO2 Private PaaS is built on top of the Apache Stratos project. It is the most complete, enterprise-grade solution, offering an open Platform as a Service, enriched with all the generic features that a PaaS would include. More significantly, it adds functionality to host pre-integrated, fully multi-tenant WSO2 Carbon middleware products as cartridges that deliver a wide range of cloud PaaS.
